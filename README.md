# SDT Template & Rule Specification

Self-Determination Theory (SDT)-friendly template and rule specification
for hybrid systems (web, mobile, smart glasses, games, APIs).

This project provides:
- A **neutral structure (not control)** for defining growth, contribution, and reflection
- User-modifiable templates and rules
- A foundation usable across databases, games, wearable devices, and APIs

## Why SDT?
SDT emphasizes:
- **Autonomy**: users choose what matters
- **Competence**: users see growth they define
- **Relatedness**: optional, non-coercive connection

This spec provides *structure without coercion*.

## What this repo is
✅ Specification (JSON Schema)  
✅ Preset templates (game, OSS, learning, habit)  
✅ Rule definition format (goals, nudges, reward candidates)  
✅ Validators (client-side / tooling only)

## What this repo is NOT
❌ Coin ledger or economy logic  
❌ Authentication / authorization  
❌ Backend / production server code  
❌ Pricing or billing logic  

> This repo is safe to use as open source.
